# Fake Trello

## Description

Experience with HyperHTML + Redux + Sails.

## WHY?

### Client

**HyperHTML** - Good idea to use literal strings instead of slow and heavy template parsers (like React, Vue ...). And i like idea of lit-html (from creators of Polymer). But its very dummy - redundant rendering, errors with wiring data.

## Server

**SailsJS** + **Mongo**


## Start

```
    npm run dev
```
which includes:  
- Webpack build  
- run Grunt tasks  
- Starts Nodemon over Sails (to monitor changes)  


## whats next on a way to persect stack?

- [ ] best structure
- [ ] more purity and immutability
- [ ] reselect, normalizer
- [ ] saga, thunk
- [ ] Feathers?
- [ ] Something to sync models with server& with different adapters (sockets, fetch). Backbone, tectonic, graph-ql, falcor)
- [ ] view engine with less coding (React?)
- [ ] CMS for REST-backend
