## Description

Experience with HyperHTML + Redux (+ Backbone?) + Sails.

## WHY?

### Client

**HyperHTML** - Good idea to use literal strings instead of slow and heavy template parsers (like React, Vue ...). And i like idea of lit-html (from creators of Polymer).
**Redux** - Timetravel & i like that app structure.
**Backbone** - later...

## Server

**SailsJS** - just because.
